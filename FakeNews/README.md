# <h1 align="center">**`Fake News`**</h1>

Welcome, below is the development of the Machine Learning Project:

## Introduction



## Definition of Project and Requirements:



## ðŸ“Š Project Scope

The following project includes the following developments:

Data Transformation and Loading
Exploratory Data Analysis
Creation of the Predictive Model
Deployment of the Application

## Data

This project was developed based on 2 files in Excel format:

The data used for this analysis project can be found at the following [download link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/155gdhdu0Jbts6t6P1BC5PRrdRLdDe5ZD?usp=sharing) 


## **DESARROLLO DEL PROYECTO ** 

## **1. ETL Process** :

Loading the file with .csv extension using the pandas library.
Then the ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Loading) work was carried out.
Various transformations were performed, meeting data standardization by analyzing nulls and duplicates, eliminating redundant columns, among other tasks such as data normalization.



## **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Once the data is clean, it's time to review the relationships between the variables in the dataset, find if there are outliers or anomalies (which don't necessarily have to be errors), and check if there is any pattern or knowledge that can be useful in a later analysis, which would be the model.



## **3. Modelo Predictivo**


## **4. Despliegue de la AplicaciÃ³n**


## **5. Conclusions**

My main conclusions are as follows:



## **6. Recommendations**
